<h2>The Display</h2>

<p>The application display is composed of the map, the Scenario and Selected Unit information boxes, the Turn Interval and Move controls, the Zoom control, and the Undo buttons.</p>
<p>The "game world" consists of a Cartesian coordinate system with the center of the world at (0,0). Each whole number represents one nautical mile. The X values increase to the right of center, and the Y values increase up from center. Each decimal number of the coordinates represent a fraction of a nautical mile.</p>
<p>If the scenario uses a map, the map center is located at (0,0). The display can be panned and zoomed (with or without a map) by using the mouse and keyboard commands. There is no limit to how far the map may be panned. The zoom factors are powers of 2 from 1 to 256, which represent the number of pixels per nautical mile in the display.</p>
