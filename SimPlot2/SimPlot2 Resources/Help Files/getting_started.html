<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>

<p>SimPlot is available for Windows PC (64 bit) and Mac (64 bit). This app was tested with Win10 and MacOS Big Sur (11.4).</p>
<p>The program will run in less than 100 MB of memory (depending on map size).  There is no special video card or monitor requirement. A mouse or touchpad is needed for selecting and editing units. An Internet connection is necessary for downloading the program plus supporting scenarios, maps, and documentation.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Unzip the downloaded SimPlot file into its own folder. No other special installation is required. For Win10, just double-click the SimPlot.exe file to start the program.</p>
<p>This application is not Apple code signed, so for Mac users you should try the following steps to run SimPlot:
	<ul>
		<li>Right-click the SimPlot2.app file and select "Show Package Contents".</li>
		<li>Navigate to the Contents/MacOS folder.</li>
		<li>Double-click the SimPlot2.exe file. You may get a security warning. Press OK.</li>
		<li>A Terminal window will appear. You may minimize it, but do not close it until after you are done running SimPlot.</li>
	</ul></p>
<p>Once SimPlot is started for the first time, it will automatically create "Scenarios" and "Maps" folders within the program's home folder if they do not already exist. Existing folders will not be overwritten. The Scenarios folder will hold scenario sub-folders and turn files.  The Maps folder will contain the map image and configuration files.</p>
