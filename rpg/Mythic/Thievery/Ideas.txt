[ ] - need generator for cities
[ ] - need generator for buildings, along with floor plans, furniture
[ ] - need generator for security in city, and buildings
    - each room/section of the house has security. there are so many fake and real security measures.
	  some are active, some are passive. 
	- when the thief arrives at a security measure, it is determined if it is real or fake, If it is
	  real, then it is determined if the thief can detect it, then disable it. If not, it goes off.
	- passive security measures are: locked doors, bars on doors/windows
	- active security measures are: guards, guard dogs, mechanical devices that detect and attack, 
	  trap doors, traps
	- location of patrols in city by guards, same as for security measures. sometimes a patrol might
	  mix things up and change its routes
	- size of patrol may change too, depending on security level of city. more crimes, activity increases
	  security level
[ ] - need generator for target profiles, behaviours, movement in home/city
    - profile on target: race, sex, age, profession, disposition, how they react when awoken or
	  confronted, habits through day, routes, how careful they are
[ ] - chaos: sometimes things dont go as planned
    - target is not where it should be
	- security is different then what was expected
	- house layout was different than what was expected
	
	
The thief adventure should cover the following phases of a heist:
* Planning: the thief has to plan things before performing the heist. They dont have to plan at all but
            the chances of success are nill if they dont.
  - scope out the route they will take to/from target, patrols, etc
  - scope out target, try to nail down as much info about target: movements, etc
  - scope out location of target's building, get as much external info
  - the hard part, try to get info on the inside security of the target house using social engineering.
