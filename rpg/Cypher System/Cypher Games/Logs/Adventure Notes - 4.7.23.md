In the hills of Tennessee, come across on foot a decently sized town. Drizzling rain welcomes Alder and Jericho to the town. This greeting forces them to seek shelter.

Name: **Destruct-ixs**
niche: they scavenge metal parts for surrounding area where there was a lot of heavy machinery, and construction equipment. They are starting to look at actual mining.

Weather: Grey clouds getting thick and it starts to drizzle.
Time: 1000

make our way to the white house inn, after Alder recovers from his poisonous event

Alder/Jericho head to The laughing coyote to see if their is a caravan heading to the pas that leads perhaps to the haven.

didn't hear anything, headed to stables. Get a lead on someone who can provide a caravan ride to the peak.
